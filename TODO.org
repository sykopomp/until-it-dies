* The Basics
** DONE Get a blank game up and running
** DONE Draw a square on the screen
** DONE Apply a texture to square
* Make it useful
** TODO Figure out resource management
   I don't really know how to handle resources right now. I want to be able to dynamically add/remove
   them, but it shouldn't rely on the GC, since it's unpredictable and resources can take up quite a
   bit of memory.
   Note: Maybe I should code this The Wrong Wayâ„¢ first. (wrong way being "load new copies of
   resources into a slot every time, and require manual unloading of each")
** TODO Write a proper texture system
** TODO Write a sprite prototype
   Everything I need to make a sprite should go into this sprite prototype. When I want
   to start animating stuff, it should all go into this sprite prototype. I'll refactor things out
   later, but first things first.
** TODO Figure out what parts of OGL I need, factor those out.
