* DONE The Basics
** DONE Get a blank game up and running
** DONE Draw a square on the screen
** DONE Apply a texture to square
** DONE Figure out resource management
   I don't really know how to handle resources right now. I want to be able to dynamically add/remove
   them, but it shouldn't rely on the GC, since it's unpredictable and resources can take up quite a
   bit of memory.
   Note: Maybe I should code this The Wrong Wayâ„¢ first. (wrong way being "load new copies of
   resources into a slot every time, and require manual unloading of each")
   UPDATE: I *think* this is enough. We'll see.
** DONE Write a proper texture system
   It's not complete, no, but it's useful enough.
** DONE Write a sprite prototype
   Everything I need to make a sprite should go into this sprite prototype. When I want
   to start animating stuff, it should all go into this sprite prototype. I'll refactor things out
   later, but first things first. (animation comes later)

* TODO Write the library modules
** TODO graphics module prototypes
*** DONE engine
*** TODO image
*** TODO animation
*** TODO font
    I want to be able to easily draw text on-screen. Using cl-ftgl might work.
    UPDATE: Improve the interface a bit, and this should be set?
*** TODO particle system
    Should I include this in the engine? Maybe this should be client-side.
** TODO audio prototypes
   cl-OpenAL seems pretty good so far. I think I can probably give this a shot already.
*** TODO sample
*** TODO music
* TODO Write tetris!
* TODO Forget this attach/detach thing.
   That should be left for a higher-level interface.
